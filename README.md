## Contribution Guidelines

To maintain the integrity of the main branch, direct push access is restricted. Contributors are encouraged to follow a branch-based workflow, submitting changes through pull requests (PRs) for review. This process ensures that all code is reviewed and tested before it's merged into the main branch, helping to maintain high code quality and stability.

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch from the latest version of `main`.
2. Make your changes, commit them to your branch, and push the branch to the repository.
3. Open a pull request from your branch to the main branch.
4. Ensure your pull request passes all automated checks and receives approval from at least one project maintainer.
