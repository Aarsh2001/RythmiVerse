## Introduction💡 

Welcome to Rythmiverse🥁 , an immersive learning platform for playing a drumkit designed for Meta Quest devices🕶️. Our application connects aspiring students🧑‍🎓 with skilled teachers🧑‍🏫 in a virtual room, where the teacher can perform drumming sequences which are in turn repeated by the student. 

## Features🌟
Our simulator has two network connected drumkits which pass a sequence of drum hits in real time from the teacher🧑‍🏫 to the student🧑‍🎓. Both participants operate the drumkit using handheld controllers representing drumsticks.🥁 

There are X playable components of the drumkit, each equiped with a different appropriate sound. The individual drums can be placed variably to allow for maximum comfort during playthrough. 

When the teacher performs a sequence, individual hits travel sequentially across the virtual room to the other user, who then tries to replicate the sequence in correct order and speed. Visual feedback (Green 🟢 - precise to Red 🔴 - unprecise) is provided for each replicated hit to indicate successrate of the student.  

The drumkit has a strength adjusted haptic, visual and audiotory feedback to emulate different intensities of drum hitting realistically.
