## Directory Structure

This repository is organized into several directories to ensure ease of navigation and a clean project structure. Below you will find a description of what goes into each directory:

### `Assets/Materials`
The `Materials` directory is dedicated to storing all material assets used in the project. Materials in Unity are used to define how the surface of the GameObjects looks, including its color, texture, and reflective qualities. Place any assets related to shaders, textures, or other material-related files here.

### `Assets/Prefabs`
The `Prefabs` directory contains all the prefabricated objects that we use across various scenes and components of our application. Prefabs are pre-configured GameObjects with attached components, properties, and child objects. These are used to maintain consistency and reusability for common objects within our VR environment such as interactive drums, teaching tools, or UI elements.

### `Assets/Scripts`
In the `Scripts` directory, you'll find all the code files written in `Ubiq`. This includes all gameplay logic, user interaction, VR-specific functionalities, and any other computational tasks. Ensure that scripts are appropriately named and documented to reflect their purpose and usage within the application.

### `Assets/Sounds`
The `Sounds` directory houses all audio files used in the application. This includes drum sounds, background music, UI clicks, and any other sound effects that enhance the immersive experience of our VR drumming simulator. Sound files should be properly formatted and optimized for in-game use.

Please make sure to store the files in their respective directories to keep the repository well-organized. Adhering to this structure is crucial for collaborative development and ensures that our application is scalable and easy to manage.
